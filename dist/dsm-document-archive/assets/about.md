# About the Archive

Over the summer in 2020, as protests happened in the streets, 
the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement and other organizations 
started turning people out in mass to Des Moines City Council Meetings. 
This unprecedented public participation in Council Meetings prompted an unprecedented amount of rule changes 
as city government tried and failed, repeatedly, 
to silence Black voices and retaliate against speech critical of the city and DMPD.

These rule changes are complicated and petty, often in response to specific 
actions taken by people in City Council Meetings to restrict or criminalize speech.
We have attempted to document some of the context 
behind why the city changed certain rules and what was changed at what time.

We start with the most recent change and work backwards to the original rules. 
We will continue to update this as council continues to amend the rules.

Some of this information may be inaccurate. 
This archive was sourced from city documents which are often incomplete or inaccurate
by people who often make mistakes.
If you find any mistakes, or you have additional context you'd like us to add,
